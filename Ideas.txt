Concept ideas for Messaging and notifications system:

For appointment notifications:
- create a user called system that will auto send out messages to recipients upon appt creations

- Message will be sent to artist to confirm date/reschedule/cancel 
        - upon cancellation system could recommend 2 other artists that are similar for booking based upon search results ranging from info or even dates

- Add some rules to not allow same time/day bookings
- Allow artist to setup availability 
- Add apointment sessions/typings (consultation, first session, second session)

- Figure out a way to handle deposit and possibly payment (venmo, paypal, cash)
